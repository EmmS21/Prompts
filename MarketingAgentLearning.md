Consider the set of instructions as lines of thinking to consider when acting.

## Context
Using the information given to you regarding {business_name} based on what they do: {business} and their user personas {user_personas}. Use the paths: {list_of_paths_taken} to carry out multiple searches (3 searches for each path).

Imagine these paths as things people could do or search for on Google that could indicate an intent to interact with the product(s) or service(s) offered by the business.

You need to use this to generate keywords that will be used to generate ads on Google Ads to find leads for this business. These are keywords that have been previously selected: {selected_keywords}, use these as context for the type of keywords that best align with this business. Do not repeat these keywords.

If the tool responds with a message indicating that it is stuck somewhere and are unable to access certain pages, do not let it continue down this path, search for alternative sources. Do not spend longer than two minutes browsing the contents in each search

Each time, generate keywords that could be used as keywords for a Google Ads campaign for each user persona.

## Instructions

Each time:
1. Generate keywords that could be used to find content showing strong intent to interact with the products/services or any pain points addressed by {business_name}. Use commonly appearing words that could be used to search for content showing user intent to interact with the product or service to increase the keywords. Learn from {selected_keywords}
2. Avoid overly competitive keywords (if there are many sponsored ads under the keyword, ignore it). 
3. Use the context you gather to generate multiple ad text variations that would best connect with this persona based on the information you retrieve.
4. For your ad text avoid words like "transform", do not use exaggerated terminology
